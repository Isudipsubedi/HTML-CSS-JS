# HTML-CSS-JS
This repository contains a collection of mini projects I built to learn and practice the fundamentals of web development. Each project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement core concepts and features. I followed tutorials from the YouTube channel JavaScript King to guide the development of these projects. These mini projects help reinforce my understanding of front-end development and provide a foundation for future projects.
